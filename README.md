I was a Ph.D. student in [Mechatronic Engineering](https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/study-with-us/undergraduate-degrees/mechatronic-engineering) in [University of New South Wales (Sydney)](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) since 2016. My research interest includes computer vision, 3D object detection, SLAM, and robotics. The thesis name is *object detection for intelligent robots in urban contexts*. My Ph.D. advisor is [Dr. Jose Guivant](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=_4IB14IAAAAJ&hl=en). I obtained my bachelor and master degreee from [Wuhan University of Technology](http://english.whut.edu.cn/) in 2013 and 2016.

Research interests:  **Object detection**, **SLAM**, **Optimization**, **Deep learning**, **Stochastic estimation**, **Computer vision**, **Roboitcs**.
